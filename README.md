# Operating Systems Labs

This repo contains my attempts to the different OS labs presented.

They were really interesting and I had a lot of fun coding them out!

### Lab 1: C Programming with Linked List, Shell Scripting

Features a few different exercises, from teaching the basics of C
by implementing a linked list to
the basics of shell scripting and bash commands.

### Lab 2: Shell Emulator

Emulates the basic functionality of shell commands using syscalls,
supporting concurrent calls with `fork()` and keeping track of
processes in a custom PCB.

### Lab 3: Semaphores and Mutex

Features a multi-threaded matching simulator that required
synchronization using semaphores and mutexes.

### Lab 4: Zero Copy Files

Features a copying mechanism using mapping of virtual memory to prevent
expensive copy syscalls.
